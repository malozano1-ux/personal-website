This project uses a **3×2×2 factorial design** to test the effects of alcohol type, music genre,
and gender on blood oxytocin levels. We fit a three-way ANOVA and check all model assumptions.

- Gender explains ~99% of the variance in oxytocin response.
- Alcohol type and music genre show no meaningful main or interaction effects.
