Using the **Cigar** dataset, this project models per-capita cigarette sales across 46 states from 1963–1992.

We compare:

- Pooled OLS
- Fixed effects
- Random effects

The Hausman test and F-tests support the **fixed effects model**, which we use to estimate price
elasticity and discuss taxation policy implications.
