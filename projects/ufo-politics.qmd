> **Status:** Work in progress

This project analyzes UFO sighting records from the National UFO Reporting Center to study whether **state political alignment** is associated with differences in sighting frequency.

Early results show:

- Democratic-leaning states tend to report **higher average sightings**.  
- Mann–Whitney, chi-square, and Poisson regression all support this pattern.  
- Narrative descriptions and sighting characteristics (shape, duration) appear **similar** across political groups.

Upcoming work includes adjusting for population, incorporating additional state-level covariates, and expanding the text analysis of witness narratives.
