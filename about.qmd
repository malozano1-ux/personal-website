title: "About Me"
---

I am an undergraduate at the **University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)**, double majoring in **Statistics & Data Science** and **Economics**. I love working at the intersection of analytics, technology, and business — especially where data-driven insights can enhance decision-making and real-world outcomes.

My academic work blends statistical modeling, machine learning, and applied econometrics with a strong interest in how data products are built, deployed, and used. Whether it’s developing predictive models, building dashboards, or designing generative-AI tools, I enjoy turning complex data problems into clear, actionable solutions.

## Core Interests

- Predictive modeling and machine learning  
- Experimental design and causal inference  
- Business intelligence, data visualization, and reporting  
- AI applications in finance, customer analytics, and operational automation  
- Using statistical thinking to solve interdisciplinary problems  

## Beyond Academics

Outside the classroom, I am deeply involved in the UCLA community:

- **Resident Assistant (RA)** — supporting residents, designing programming, and building inclusive communities  
- **Latin American Student Organization (LASO)** — leadership roles focused on mentorship, cultural engagement, and event planning  
- **Engineers Without Borders (EWB)** — supporting internal operations and member coordination  
- Active involvement in other campus and professional organizations  

These experiences have strengthened my communication, project management, and leadership skills, and they inspire me to bring empathy and structure into every team I work with.

## Looking Ahead

I’m excited about opportunities that let me combine analytics, creativity, and technology — especially roles where I can contribute to data-driven products, scalable systems, or AI-enabled tools with real impact.
